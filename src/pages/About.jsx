          Long before written history, Slavic tribes worshipped a pantheon of powerful deities.
          Their world was ruled by balance: life and death, fire and water, light and shadow.
        </p>
        <p className="fade-in-delay-2">
          This project is a digital resurrection of that forgotten world. A place where the
          spirits of old gods still whisper, where runes bleed meaning, and rituals echo in
          dark forests.
        </p>
        <p className="fade-in-delay-3">
          Dive deep into the mythology, uncover ancient symbols, and walk among deities
          that once shaped empires with thunder, wisdom, and chaos.
